# Razor-Tools
The Razor Tools library is designed to wrap JavaScript and JQuery objects into C# methods. Objects can be easily added to Razor views with basic C# code. All objects are created and initialized using unobtrusive JavaScript techniques and fluent API. This allows complex objects to be created within your views with simple C# statements.
