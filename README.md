# Razor-Tools
The Razor Tools library is designed to wrap JavaScript and JQuery objects into C# methods. Objects can be easily added to Razor views with basic C# code. All objects are created and initialized using unobtrusive JavaScript techniques and fluent API. This allows complex objects to be created within your views with simple C# statements.

## Mvc.RazorTools.Base
This library provides the base class for all RazorTools objects. It provides the basic code for building tags and embedding them in Razor views. Al of the RazorTools packages will be based on this library. Generally, you will not add this library directly to your project.

## Mvc.RazorTools.Charts
Create simple charts in you Razor views. This library wraps morris.js charts along with some other tools to produce nice looking charts. For more information see the documentation in the repo Wiki pages: https://github.com/porrey/Razor-Tools/wiki/RazorTools-Charts.
